## Introduction

Astro has become one of my favorite frameworks for building content-focused websites. When combined with MDX, it offers an incredibly powerful authoring experience that bridges the gap between writing markdown and building interactive components.

## Why Astro?

Astro's island architecture is brilliant for content sites:

- **Zero JavaScript by default**: Ship only what you need
- **Framework agnostic**: Use React, Vue, Svelte, or plain HTML
- **Content collections**: Type-safe content management
- **Fast builds**: Optimized for performance

## MDX Integration

MDX brings the best of both worlds:

```jsx
import MyComponent from '../components/MyComponent.astro';

# This is markdown

<MyComponent prop="value" />

Still markdown here!
```

This flexibility means you can:

1. Write primarily in markdown for speed
2. Add interactive components where needed
3. Maintain type safety throughout

## Content Collections

Astro's content collections provide schema validation:

```typescript
const blog = defineCollection({
  type: 'content',
  schema: z.object({
    title: z.string(),
    description: z.string(),
    date: z.coerce.date(),
  }),
});
```

## Conclusion

The combination of Astro and MDX creates a sweet spot for developer experience and user experience. You get the authoring speed of markdown with the power of components when you need them.
