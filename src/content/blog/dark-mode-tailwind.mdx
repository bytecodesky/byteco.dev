## The Rise of Dark Mode

Dark mode has evolved from a niche preference to a standard feature in modern web applications. Users expect it, and implementing it well can significantly improve user experience, especially for content-heavy sites.

## Why Tailwind for Dark Mode?

Tailwind CSS makes dark mode implementation straightforward with its built-in `dark:` variant:

```html
<div class="bg-white dark:bg-slate-900 text-slate-900 dark:text-slate-100">
  Content that adapts to dark mode
</div>
```

## CSS Custom Properties Approach

For more flexibility, I prefer using CSS custom properties with Tailwind:

```css
:root {
  --color-bg: 255 255 255;
  --color-text: 15 23 42;
}

@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
  :root {
    --color-bg: 15 23 42;
    --color-text: 241 245 249;
  }
}
```

Then in your Tailwind config:

```javascript
theme: {
  extend: {
    colors: {
      bg: 'rgb(var(--color-bg) / <alpha-value>)',
      text: 'rgb(var(--color-text) / <alpha-value>)',
    }
  }
}
```

## Design Considerations

When implementing dark mode:

1. **Contrast is crucial**: Ensure text remains readable
2. **Reduce pure whites and blacks**: Use softer tones
3. **Adjust colors**: Some colors need different saturation in dark mode
4. **Test with real content**: Always verify with actual text and images

## Code Syntax Highlighting

Don't forget about code blocks! They need special attention in dark mode. Consider using a dark-friendly syntax theme like:

- Night Owl
- Dracula
- Nord

## Accessibility

Always respect user preferences:

```javascript
const darkMode = window.matchMedia('(prefers-color-scheme: dark)');
darkMode.addEventListener('change', (e) => {
  // Handle theme change
});
```

## Conclusion

Dark mode isn't just about inverting colors. It's about creating a cohesive, comfortable experience that respects user preferences and maintains your design's integrity across both modes.
